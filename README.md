# Overview:

Experiment 5 comprised pressing a response key when a high-pitched tone was heard, following a rhythmic precursor sequence of noise bursts whose overall duration was relatively unpredictable. Thus experiment 5 was a simple detection task making minimal demands on memory and cognitive processing. If participants' RTs are affected by IOI variance it will imply that the findings of experiments 1 to 4 were caused by processes that are relatively general to perception-action tasks. If an effect of IOI variance is not found, it will suggest that the findings of experiments 1 to 4 are specific to complex decision making.

It was hypothesised that IOI variance would affect response times in ways similar to that of experiments 1 to 4, and that the duration of the rhythmic sequence used on each trial would interact with effects of IOI variance on response.
The latter is compatible with attentional entrainment models and implies that prolonged exposure towards a rhythmic sequence is required in order for its statistical qualities to influence response.

# Requirements:

MATLAB (MathWorks) - the program was build in version R2015b. Psychtoolbox3 (http://psychtoolbox.org/) - version 3.0.13 - Flavor: beta - Corresponds to SVN Revision 8038.

# Installation:

Clone the respository to a local folder and set MATLABs current directory to the selected folder. Enter 'temporal_variability' into the MATLAB terminal to start the experiment. Ensure that any hardcoded URLs in the run file are changed to represent the directory structure on your computer.
